## What is [steganography)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography)?
Steganography is the act of concealing data inside of images, using various techniques such as looking only at the [LSB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_significant_bit) or using the [alpha channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(graphic)) of an image. This is a short list of all the possible options that steganography offers.

## What does this site do?
This site offers users the chance to encode text into any image, as well as the ability to analyze a given image for previously hidden text.
