            <h2>About Steganography:</h2>
            <p>Steganography is the process of concealing data inside images, using various techniques, such as only looking at the LSB or
                using the alpha channel of an image.

                This practice was first recorded in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius, who hid messages in images, lists and other words.



                The location of the binary integer that determines whether the number is even or odd is called
                the least significant bit (LSB).
